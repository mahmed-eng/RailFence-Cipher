# Rail Fence Cipher

This is a simple web application that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Rail Fence Cipher algorithm.

## Usage

1. Enter the text you want to encrypt in the "Enter Text" textarea.
2. Enter the number of rails you want to use for encryption in the "Enter Number of Rails" input field.
3. Click on the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the text.
4. The encrypted text will be displayed in the textarea labeled "Result."

Alternatively:

1. Enter the cipher text you want to decrypt in the "Enter Cipher Text" textarea.
2. Enter the number of rails used for encryption in the "Enter Number of Rails" input field.
3. Click on the "Decrypt" button to decrypt the cipher text.
4. The decrypted text will be displayed in the textarea labeled "Result."

## How It Works

- The Rail Fence Cipher is a transposition cipher that works by writing the message in a zigzag pattern across a number of "rails" or lines.
- During encryption, characters of the plaintext are written diagonally up and down across the specified number of rails.
- During decryption, the zigzag pattern is reconstructed to reveal the original message.
- The number of rails used during encryption must be known in order to decrypt the message correctly.
